Monopoly Game using Python and ExpectMax Algorithm

Introduction:
This is a simple Monopoly Game developed using Python and ExpectMax Algorithm. The game is designed to be played by two players. The aim of the game is to become the richest player by buying and developing properties, charging rent to other players who land on the property and avoiding bankruptcy.

Prerequisites:
1. Python 3.x
2. requirements.txt

How to play:
1. To start the game, run the "main.py" file in your Python IDE.
2. Two players can play the game.
3. The game starts with player 1 rolling the dice. The number on the dice will determine the number of moves the player can make on the board.
4. If a player lands on an unowned property, they can choose to buy the property by paying the listed price. If they choose not to buy, the property will go up for auction.
5. If a player lands on a property owned by another player, they must pay rent to the owner.
6. If a player lands on a Chance or Community Chest space, they must draw a card and follow the instructions.
7. The game continues until one player goes bankrupt, and the other player is declared the winner.

ExpectMax Algorithm:
The game uses the ExpectMax Algorithm to determine the best move for the computer player. The algorithm works by considering all possible moves and selecting the move that yields the highest expected value. The computer player is programmed to buy properties, develop them, and charge rent to other players.

Conclusion:
This Monopoly Game using Python and ExpectMax Algorithm is a fun and engaging way to play the classic board game. It is a great way to learn about programming concepts such as algorithms and game design. Have fun playing!
